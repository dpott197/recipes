  "recipe_instructions": "Heat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Line a 20x30cm/8x12in baking tin with baking parchment. Gently melt the butter and the sugar together in a large pan. Take off the heat and beat in the rest of the ingredients. Turn into the baking tin and bake for 30-40 minutes until the top of the brownie is firm but the inside still feels soft. Take out of the oven and cool in the tin. Cut into 5cm/2in squares when cool. Perfect with a cup of tea."
